# Heart-Disease-Prediction
🩺 Disease Detector
📌 Overview

The Disease Detector is a machine learning project aimed at predicting diseases using patient health information. By applying classification algorithms, the model processes medical attributes/symptoms and generates predictions that can support healthcare diagnostics.

This project is built in Python using Jupyter Notebook, making use of popular ML libraries for training, testing, and evaluation.

🚀 Key Features

-Preprocessing and cleaning of medical datasets

-Training ML models for disease classification

-Model performance evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

-Saving/exporting trained models for reuse

-Simple workflow through Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Tech Stack

-Python 3.x
-NumPy, Pandas → Data analysis & preprocessing
-Scikit-learn → Machine learning models
-Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization
-Joblib → Saving and loading trained models
